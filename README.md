Use this repository to report bugs / issues you encounter while playing. Also, if you have ideas to improve the client, feel free to share them with us!
Please keep these rules in mind when submitting something:

- Use correct templates
- Check if a similar issue already exists, if yes please comment on that one instead of opening a new one
- Attach crash reports and minecraft logs if possible.
